# Required on PATH: swtpm

# Functions intentionally assign SWTPM_PID in the *caller's* shell scope
# (no `local`) so the orchestrator's cleanup trap can reach it.
#
# Shell options (set -o pipefail, etc.) are owned by the caller; this
# library does not modify them.

# start_swtpm <state-dir> <socket-path> <log-path>
#   Launches swtpm in the background and sets SWTPM_PID in the caller's
#   shell. Does NOT wait for the socket to become ready — call
#   wait_for_swtpm_socket afterwards.
