# shellcheck shell=bash

# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
#
# Required on PATH: swtpm
#
# Functions intentionally assign SWTPM_PID in the *caller's* shell scope
# (no `local`) so the orchestrator's cleanup trap can reach it.
#
# Shell options (set -o pipefail, etc.) are owned by the caller; this
# library does not modify them.

# require_swtpm_tools
#   Verifies the external tools this library needs are on PATH. On any
#   miss, prints the missing commands to stderr and returns 1 so the
#   orchestrator can fail loudly at startup instead of producing a
#   confusing mid-run failure.

# start_swtpm <state-dir> <socket-path> <log-path>
#   Launches swtpm in the background and sets SWTPM_PID in the caller's

# wait_for_swtpm_socket <socket-path> [tenths-of-second-timeout=50]
